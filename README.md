To see the dataset available at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston

Basically, I used this analysis to answer the following questions:

1. What are the main characteristics of the AirBNB listings in Boston?
2. Which variables can determine the price of an AirBNB listing?
3. When is the best time of the year to find available properties in Boston?

## Results
